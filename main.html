<h1>Code Optimization</h1>
<p>We can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization.</p>
<ol>
<li>We can reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied.</li>
<li>We can reduce the memory usage of the program and increase it's total run time.</li>
<li>We can reduce both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algorithms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some specific examples of how to optimize code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use efficient algorithms.</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary loops.</li>
<li>Minimize the use of memory.</li>
<li>Use data structures that are appropriate for the task at hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you can improve the performance of your code and make it more efficient.</p>
